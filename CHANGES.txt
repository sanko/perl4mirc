Version 0.999.999 | Fri, 27 Nov 2009

    API Changes/Compatibility Information:
     * The module that comes along with this package has been renamed
       perl4mIRC.pm => mIRC.pm

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * We no longer destroy the perl interpreter when mIRC times out the dll

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Use a custom PerlIO layer to redirect STDOUT/STDERR to mIRC signals

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:

    Notes:
     * This release is huge as it...
       - removes all non-core dependancies :D
     * The PerlIO stuff is... unstable. Use with care.

Version 0.999.700 | Wed, 25 Jun 2009

    API Changes/Compatibility Information:
     * STDERR/STDOUT now trigger signals instead of echo
     * perl4mIRC.pm **MUST** be in either $mircdir/lib/ or $mircdir/perl/
     * Hacky mIRC pseudo-hash mess has been removed. Use mIRC->var('blah') to
       retrieve the value and mIRC->set('blah') to... set it. Obviously.
     * mIRC identifiers are now run like mIRC->echo('some text');

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * N/A

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * eval'd code is now shoved into a sub for safety. Fixes a random crash bug.
     * new mIRC package

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * perl.mrc and Readme.txt updated to reflect new API changes

    Notes:
     * I'll keep up with this project a little better than I have. I promise.
